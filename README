=== Test Gear client library (libtestgear) ===


1. Introduction

    This is the Test Gear client library which offers an API for communicating
    with Test Gear device servers. The API allows client applications to
    connect, load plugins, query/manage variables, run commands, and finally
    disconnect from Test Gear device servers.

    It is part of the Test Gear project which aims to create a simple hardware
    test framework for use with any type of GNU/Linux based system.


2. Status

    The code is currently considered highly experimental. API and internals are
    subject to change. Use on your own risk. For now, consider it a playground
    for experiments.

3. Development

    This is open source. If you want to help out with the project please join
    in. Any contributions (code, doc, ideas, etc.) are welcome.
